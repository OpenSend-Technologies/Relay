## What is a relay?
A relay is a server that relays information onwards to somewhere else.
## What does an OpenSend relay do?
An OpenSend relay helps to fight censorship by routing traffic from the client, to the destination server (or another relay in some cases). Relays cannot see message content or manipulate response content. All traffic going through relays is encrypted end-to-end.
## Why are relays important?
Relays make blocking OpenSend harder. By using relays, the actual hitting of server IP addresses (which will most likely be blocked quickly), blocking becomes a lot harder. If relays switch IP addresses often, this makes blocking even harder than that.
## What do relays need?
- High bandwidth
- Prefrebly a non-existant data cap
- A decent amount of resources AND threads
- Stable hosting
